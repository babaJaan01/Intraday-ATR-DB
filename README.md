# ATR analysis

***note: this is not financial advise, it's just a fun project I made***

This basically finds out how volatile a stock/crypto is by finding out it's ATR (average true value). 

Higher ATR = higher volatility = higher risk, vice versa

ATR can be used to help manage risk, set appropriate stop losses, determine good position sizes, and to anticipate market behavior based off of historical volatility trends.

The current notebook shows ATR for a 7 day period, but to make it intraday ("within the day") the window arg has to change in the code
